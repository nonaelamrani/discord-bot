Create a Discord Soccer League Bot using Node.js 18+ and discord.js v14 with an SQLite database. The bot manages teams, players, referees, and match statistics in a league environment. The bot should use slash commands, embeds, and button interactions.

Features and Commands:

Team Management

/team create name short role → Create a team and assign a Discord role.

/team delete role → Delete a team.

/team offer player salary duration → Managers send a contract offer via DM with Accept/Decline buttons. Accepting gives the player the team role. Only managers can use this command.

/team release player → Managers release a player from their team.

/team roster → Show names of all players in the team.

/team setmanager manager → Assign a manager to a team; automatically gives manager role and team role.

Player Management

/player info player → Show only player stats: goals, assists, mentions, MOTM counts. No number, position, rating, or team info.

Referee Management

/referee set user → Assign a referee role and add user to database.

/referee remove user → Remove a referee.

/referee list → List all referees.

Statistics Management (Referees/Admins Only)

/stats logchannel channel → Set a channel for logging stat changes.

/stats addgoal player → Increment goals.

/stats removegoal player → Decrement goals (admin only).

/stats addassist player → Increment assists.

/stats removeassist player → Decrement assists (admin only).

/stats addmention players... → Increment mentions for one or more players.

/stats removemention player → Decrement mentions.

/stats addmotm player → Increment MOTM count.

/stats removemotm player → Decrement MOTM count.

Member-Accessible Stats Commands

/stats playerstats player → Show only goals, assists, mentions, MOTM counts.

/stats topscorers → Show players with the highest goals.

/stats topplayermakers → Show players with the highest assists.

Database Structure:

Teams: id, name, short, role_id, manager_id, created_at

Players: id, discord_id, name, goals, assists, mentions, motm

Memberships: link players to teams with role (player or manager)

Referees: discord_id

Settings: key-value pairs (e.g., log channel)

Interactions & Permissions:

All offers are sent via DMs with Accept/Decline buttons; confirmation messages are sent to player.

Manager commands require manager role + team role.

Stat-modifying commands require referee or admin roles; normal players can only view stats.

Teams are automatically resolved via role ID to avoid typing errors.

Implementation Requirements:

Slash commands must place required options before optional options to avoid Discord errors.

Embed messages for offers, rosters, and player stats.

Button interactions must respond properly to avoid “Unknown Interaction” errors.

Fully handle database read/write with SQLite.

Include proper error handling and logging.
